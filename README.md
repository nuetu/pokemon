# pokemon

Pokemon text game in python!

1. Download then rename files

- pokedex.json @ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json/master/pokedex.json
- movedex.json @ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json/master/moves.json

2. Run initialize.py, copy everything from pokedex.py to the bottom of pokemon.py
3. Copy the typedex from initialize.py to the bottom of pokemon.py

4. Run main.py, and enjoy!

Current version - moves given to pokemon from initialize.py are random!

If teaching this, students should be familiar with

- Objects
- Importing files
- Occasional List comprehension
- List, Dictionary, and Tuples
- Function calls, returns and while loops

Code in order -

1. Code player.py, to understand objects
2. Run initialize.py for your student (if replit, just have 1 line in main.py "import initialize" and run)
3. Delete initialize.py and pokedex.py after you copied the necessary information
4. Code pokemon.py
5. Code main.py, start with the while loop, the commands function, and then code functions as you call them from the commands function
6. Code challenge.py
7. Enjoy!
